Steps to Commiting from Git Shell (blue terminal)

1. cd into the project folder (ScreenShow in our case)
	cd ScreenShow
2. Tell Git to keep track of the files you want to keep track of
	git add . OR git add <SPECIFIC FILE NAME WITHOUT THE ANGLEBRACKETS>
3. Commit changes to a specific branch and give it a name
	git commit -m "this commits to master branch" OR git commit SPECIFICBRANCH "this commits to a specific branch"
4. Push your changes to Github
	git push

and if you need to know what is going on at any point run:
	git status
